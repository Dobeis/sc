So many questions
So many fears
So many gods

Only one life to live here
In this human body
Usually whom that arrives here 
Come without the memory
Without all the wisdom that we have there 
But I know 
I comes consciently 
As if I were awake 
The feelings 
The connections 
Everything in everywhere
Free in two dimensions 
I'm the unipresent one
I'm the one who don't respect the chronological laws

I'm is all that you feel
All that you fear
All that you want 
I'm your orgasm momentum
An explosion a fragment of dust
I'm in you
And you are me
Oh, my little son
Behold, behold
Behold your insignificant birth
And live it as you were a god
Because you have the same power of me
The most valuable gift that I gave to you
The creation can create
The creation can destroy
All is mind 
Mind is before the creation

My son
Behold, behold 
This life is your unique passage in this game

You can choose to be a slave or to become a god
Your legacy can echoes from eternity
I wait only for one time to see you in my place
In a vast sea of infinite combinations 
Maybe I can feel the taste of life
One one time 
I wait for the taste of the meaning of our existence
