Milions years of evolution guided by instincts
Primitive ways that brought the mankind to nowadays
like another species in nature war is wrote in our DNA code
unlike another species in nature our extinction will be our pride 

A perfect biological machine
The most advanced technology 
Improved social skills
Concience and values 
We created extraction machines
We dominate the medicines
Are we result of an accidental fact?
Or are we a breed of creator´s power?

What is the origin of our race? 
are we a god´s tool or a random accident?
Maybe we are living in an unsystematic virtual space

Human - Insignificant race
Living in a insignificant planet
In a little fraction of time
Seeking a puspose to life

Human - god or spawn
Fearing the final dawn
Consuming foolish lies  
to sate our need for fell special

The future of mankind is a blank page
Can we change or rewrite our existence?
Human still leanding to extinction - A natural process
So seat down and whatch this world suffer

Milions years of evolution guided by instincts
Primitive ways that brought the mankind to nowadays
like another species in nature war is wrote in our DNA code
unlike another species in nature our extinction will be our pride 

A perfect biological machine
The most advanced technology 
Improved social skills
Concience and values 
The nature on favor of human
Consuming enviroment resources exponentialy
Multiplying our race as bacteria
Leading the planet to a critical extinction 

Can this world was created for us?
A reality created by a superior race?
So we are living in a systematic virtual space

With the same power of the gods
We still reign in this world
Conquering thrones and lifes
And fearing the death 

looking for more responses 
walking between religions and science
there is no true to follow
and we still fearing the death

The future of mankind is a blank page
Can we change or rewrite our existence?
the human is on its way towards extinction - A natural process
So seat down and whatch this world suffer
